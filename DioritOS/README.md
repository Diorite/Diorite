Client implementation of Diorite-Core<br/>
Diorite is a game based and compatible with Minecraft.<br/>

Using this client you will be able to join any Minecraft server, but it will also provide additional ways to extend game, including:
* Mod API compatible with server. You need create one plugin and it will work on client and server.
* Custom packets to fast adding simple elements like new blocks, textures, models etc...
* Client not need have all mods to join a Diorite server, only selected ones.
* **May** support Forge in future.

Client may not include single-player mode at all. (maybe someday)
