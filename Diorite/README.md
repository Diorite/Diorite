Server implementation of Diorite-Core<br/>
Diorite is a game based and compatible with Minecraft.<br/>

Diorite server will be compatible with Minecraft client, as long as server administrator will not add any mods that are needed on client too. </br>
It will also provide additional ways to extend game, including:
* Mod API compatible with client. You need create one plugin and it will work on client and server.
* Custom packets to fast adding simple elements like new blocks, textures, models etc...
* Client not need have all mods to join a Diorite server, only selected ones.
* **May** support Forge in future.
