 * if we put some other items to crafting (not a log) without group diorite need check
 * 6 times near this same recipe, a log of some type. <br>
 * With group we first validate group recipe, and check if this is any type of log,
 * so it will be only one simple check to say that recipe is invalid instead of 6.
