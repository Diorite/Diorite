[*Diorite-Core*](https://github.com/Diorite/Diorite-Core) | [Diorite-API](https://github.com/Diorite/Diorite-API)

Core project for Diorite client and server, with basic implementation of DioriteAPI.<br/>
Diorite is game based and compatible with Minecraft.<br/>
Don't take this project too serious, I created it only to play with Netty and Multithreading.<br/>
It may never be finished, or usable.<br/>

PS: keep free to implementing anything, even if it listed for next versions.
