# Diorite-Core
Minecraft Server, Implementation of Diorite-API. <br>
Don't take this project too serious, I created it only to play with Netty and Multithreading. <br>
It may never be finished, or usable.<br><br>

Diorite-API: <br>

# Basic goals
* Make it work, good enough to allow player see flat map, and walk on it.
* Implement all packets.
* Make it multithreaded, and scalable, so if one thread isn't enough to handle all players and data, then create second one to help.

# Dream goals
* Implement all blocks.
* Implement all entities.
* Implement all other stuff...
* Make it usable.
