Minecraft Server, Implementation of Diorite-API. <br>
Don't take this project too serious, I created it only to play with Netty and Multithreading. <br>
It may never be finished, or usable.<br><br>
Current packets and connections are based on Minecraft code, it may change later.<br><br>

# Basic goals
- [x] Make it work, good enough to allow player see flat map, and walk on it.
- [ ] Implement all packets.
- [ ] Make it multithreaded, and scalable, so if one thread isn't enough to handle all players and data, then create second one to help.

# Dream goals
- [ ] Implement all blocks.
- [ ] Implement all entities.
- [ ] Implement all other stuff...
- [ ] Make it usable.
